Cathy is a marvelous little windows app that let you very quickly create catalogs of your folders/dvd.
check it out : http://www.mtg.sk/rva/
never found a better app for this kind of task.

this code can retrieve the files and folders infos from the .caf binary files generated by Cathy.

goal would be to create a complete .caf files export module (Cathy generates one binary .caf for each folder/dvd you index),
that could help for some python/django media file catalog or for big project like kodi (DVDrom lookup)

for now it's very alpha stage, it's able to read .caf files and create a python objet from each. There's some methods available (see source)
